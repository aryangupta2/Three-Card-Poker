# Three-Card-Poker
Java-Based Project made within the ICS4U0 course. Project is based off the casino game where players are each dealt a deck of three cards after an initial buy-in fee and decide whether they want to continue playing or not. It was built so that the game can be played across multiple computers, with one main "host" and up to a max of 17 players using a Java server program.
